# Supporting the patcher

OpenCore Legacy Patcher is a hobby project for us developers, and while we love helping out the community it's very difficult for us to troubleshoot issues remotely. The best way for us to get to work on the patcher, fix issues and add enhancements is having the hardware in-hand. As a hobby project, neither of the main developers can afford to buy every legacy Mac to test on. In reality only one of us even has a legacy Mac to test on, a MacBook7,1 and the other has no Mac at all.

The best way to support us in all honesty is to donate any old hardware you no longer need, as this allows us to have machines to test locally and push fixes much faster. While we appreciate cash donations, this makes it much more difficult for us to handle as an organization.

Main hardware we'd appreciate:

* Any Mac you own
  * Does require SSE4,1 CPU to test on Sierra and newer however
* Any legacy GPU supporting macOS
  * Does not require to be Mac flashed
  * Following generations would would be beneficial:
    * Nvidia 8000 series through 500
	* AMD/ATI 2000 series through 6000

If you have any legacy hardware you're willing to donate, please contact us at the following email:
